"Powered by MathJax"
********************

We are proud of the work we have done on MathJax, and we hope you are
proud to use it.  If you are, and would like to show your support for
the MathJax project, please consider including a "Powered by MathJax"
web badge on your pages that use it.


    .. image:: images/badge.gif

To do so, copy the following HTML into your web page to display the
MathJax badge on your page.

.. code-block:: html

    <a href="http://www.mathjax.org/">
        <img src="http://www.mathjax.org/badge.gif" border="0"
             alt="Powered by MathJax" title="Powered by MathJax">
    </a>

We are committed to maintaining the highest standards of excellence
for MathJax, and part of that is avoiding confusion and misleading
impressions; therefore, if you do use our badge, we ask that you
observe the following simple rules.

**Do:**

- Use the approved badge graphic and HTML snippet.

- Tell us about your site, if you wish, so we can create a directory
  of sites using MathJax.

**Don’t:**

- Manipulate the graphic, incorporate it into other designs or use
  other graphics from the mathjax.org site.

- Use the graphic in advertisements, product packaging or collateral
  materials, or in other printed materials.

- Use to logo to imply sponsorship, or endorsement, or otherwise
  associate the logo with false, defamatory, misleading or obscene
  statements.

If you have a special situation that doesn’t seem compatible with
these rules, please `contact us <http://www.mathjax.org/contact>`_; we
should be able to work out something that works for us both.
